# AIM: 
To study and implement aggregate functions, group by and having clause with suitable examples.
# THEORY:
An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.
Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.
## The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:
### - MIN() 
Returns the smallest value within the selected column
#### Syntax: 
```
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#### Example:
SELECT MIN (Sal) FROM emp;

### - MAX() 
Returns the largest value within the selected column
#### Syntax: 
```
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#### Example:
SELECT MAX (Sal) FROM emp;

### - COUNT() 
Returns the number of rows in a set
#### Syntax: 
```
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#### Example: 
SELECT COUNT (Sal) FROM emp;

### - SUM() 
Returns the total sum of a numerical column
#### Syntax: 
```
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#### Example: 
SELECT SUM (Sal) From emp;

### - AVG()
Returns the average value of a numerical column
#### Syntax: 
```
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#### Example: 
Select AVG (10, 15, 30) FROM DUAL;

## GROUP BY: 
This query is used to group all the records in a relation together for each and every value of a specific key(s) and then display them for a selected set of fields in the relation. 
### Syntax: 
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```
### Example: 
SQL> SELECT EMPNO, SUM (SALARY) FROM EMP GROUP BY EMPNO; 

## GROUP BY-HAVING: 
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions. The HAVING clause must follow the GROUP BY clause in a query and must also precede the ORDER BY clause if used. 
### Syntax: 
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```
